Checking Divisibility by 3,
  Take the number to be checked as input 'a';
  assign the value l=0;
  While a is not eequal to zero(a!=0),
     assign another variable k=a%10; (this variable finds last digit of the number)
     assign another variable l=l+k; (this helps in finding sum of the digits)
     assign the variabe a as a=(a-k)/10; (this changes value of a to keep it ready for the next step in loop)
  If l%3==0,(if l is divisible by 3)
     output "True"
   else 
     output "False"
