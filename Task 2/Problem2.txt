Providing nth term of fibonacci series
   Take the n value as input;
   assign a variable a=0;
   assign a variable b=1;
   assign a variable c=0;
   if n=1,
     assign c=1
    else
     for i=0 to n-2 (n-2 because the term coming after n number of loops will be n+2th term)
       assign c=a+b;
       assign a=b;
       assign b=c;(this is to create a,b for next repition of loop if exists)
   output c;(This will give you your nth term of fibonacci series)
